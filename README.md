# 🐦 Flappy Bird — JavaScript Canvas Game

A browser-based Flappy Bird clone built using HTML5 Canvas and Vanilla JavaScript.

---

## 🎮 Controls

- Press **Space** to start
- Press **Space** to jump
- Avoid pillars and screen boundaries
- Score increases after passing pillars
- High score is saved automatically

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time game loop using `requestAnimationFrame`
- Delta-time based physics
- Gravity and jump mechanics
- Random pillar generation
- Collision detection
- Score and high score system
- Cloud background animation
- Sound effects
- Game states (start, playing, game over)

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- HTML5 Canvas
- Game loop architecture
- Delta time (`dt`)
- Object-oriented thinking
- Collision detection (AABB)
- State management
- LocalStorage
- Event handling
